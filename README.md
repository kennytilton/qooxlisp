# qooxlisp
The Last Web App Framework You Will Ever Evaluate: qooxdoo, Lisp, and Cells

Unless you like Clojure/ClojureScript, in which case you want to evaluate [mxWeb](https://github.com/kennytilton/mxweb-trainer).

If you (sensibly) prefer Common Lisp, the above is where you can learn about qooxlisp. Then ping me directly for help with qooxlisp if you like. I can be found on the #clojurians Slack as @kennytilton.
